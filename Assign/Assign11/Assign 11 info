This assignment involves writing a server and client program to communicate using the UDP protocol. 
The server takes an IP address and port as command line arguments, binds to them, and waits for incoming messages, 
displaying the sender's address, port, and message content. The client takes the server's address and port as 
arguments and sends a simple message to the server. Both programs handle necessary conversions for IP addresses and 
ports, create and bind sockets, and use the appropriate system calls for sending and receiving messages.
